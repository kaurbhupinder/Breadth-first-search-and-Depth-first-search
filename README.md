# Breadth-first-search-and-Depth-first-search
This project is done in C++ and it can be run in Microsoft visual studio.
This Project implements Breadth First Search Algorithm to find shortest distance from root node to all other nodes.
This Project also implemnts Depth First Search Algorithm to find discover and finish time of each and every node and finds different 
types of edges for e.g Forward edge, Back edge, Tree edge and Cross edge. This projects gives the topological sort of the vertices.
